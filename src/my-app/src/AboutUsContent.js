      'Adopted by ancestors of the Muslim Khatri community, Ajrakh block printing is a 3,000-year-old craft that uses natural dyes made of indigo, henna, turmeric, pomegranate, rhubarb, and mud to create fabric. The geometric patterns of the Ajrakh block print are inspired by Islamic architecture, and the intricate 16-step process of creating the textile ensures that the colours don’t run when the fabric is washed.An aspect that adds more character to the region is its history. The region was occupied by the uprooted villagers of Dhamadka, located 50 kilometres from Ajrakhpur, which was destroyed by the 2001 Gujarat earthquake.'

      'The village of Nirona is popular for the 300-year-old art of Rogan embroidery whose legacy has been carried on by the famous native Khatri family. The Rogan thread is prepared by heating castor oil for over 12 hours till it catches fire, and then mixing it with cold water and colour. A six-inch thick-metal needle is then used to paint with a fine strand of rogan on a piece of cloth. The Khatri family offers free demonstrations, as well as a variety of fabrics for sale. You can choose to walk in or book an appointment by contacting them. '
